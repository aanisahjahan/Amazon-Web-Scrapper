# Amazon-Web-Scrapper
This project is a Python-based Amazon web scraper that extracts detailed product information from Amazon product pages and stores it in a neatly formatted Excel spreadsheet. The script leverages the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries for web scraping and data extraction, making it easy to collect key product details like name, price and more.
